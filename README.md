# E-Commerce-Customer-Purchase-Analysis
## Introduction
This project is based on the analysis of Women's E-commerce Clothing Reviews dataset taken from Kaggle. The objective of this project is to perform data preprocessing to clean the data and perform data analysis to gain insights from the reviews. Additionally, we have used LDA topic modeling to get the most three dominating topics from the reviews and then trained machine learning models to predict the number of product recommendations based on input features.
## Technologies
The following technologies were used in this project:
1.Python

2.Pandas

3.Matplotlib

4.Seaborn

5.NLTK

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is an important step to prepare the data for analysis. In this project, we performed the following preprocessing steps:

●	Removed missing values and duplicates

●	Cleaned the text data by removing punctuation, numbers and special characters

●	Removed stop words and performed lemmatization

●	Encoded categorical features using one-hot encoding

## Data Analysis
In this project, we analyzed the data using the following visualizations:

●	Donut chart to show the distribution of product recommendations

●	Bar chart to show the department-wise product recommendations

●	Histogram to show the age-wise product purchases by department

●	Treegraph to show the class-wise distribution of sold products

●	Word cloud to show positive and negative reviews

●	Correlation matrix to show the correlation between the target variable and input features
## LDA Topic Modeling
We used LDA topic modeling to get the most three dominating topics from the reviews. The topics were:
1.	Product Feel
2.	Appearance
3.	Dress Sizing and Fitting

## Recommendations
Based on the analysis, we suggest the following recommendations:

●	Improve the sizing and fitting of products in the Trend department to increase the product recommendations and reduce bad ratings

●	Focus on improving the appearance of the products as it is one of the dominating topics in the reviews

●	Provide better product feel to improve the customer satisfaction and increase the product recommendations


## Conclusion
This project has provided valuable insights into the Women's E-commerce Clothing Reviews dataset. The data preprocessing steps and data analysis techniques used in this project can be applied to similar datasets to gain insights and make informed decisions.
